# üìå App Development Process - Detroit Air Quality Analyzer

## Step 1: Determine Your Target Users
**Public Health Advocates** in the Detroit Metropolitan Area who need accessible air quality data to inform community health initiatives and policy advocacy.

## Step 2: Select your dataset and ensure you can analyze it

### üîç Dataset Understanding
1Ô∏è‚É£ **What is my dataset about in one sentence?**  
This dataset contains daily PM2.5 air quality measurements from 12 monitoring stations across the Detroit Metropolitan Area during the first quarter of 2025.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **How many rows and columns does it have?**  
The dataset contains 1,138 rows (daily readings from 12 stations) and 11 columns.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **List 3-5 of the most important columns and what they represent.**  
- `Date`: The date when the measurement was taken
- `Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration`: Average concentration of PM2.5 particulate matter in Œºg/m¬≥
- `Daily AQI Value`: Air Quality Index value calculated from PM2.5 levels
- `Local Site Name`: Name of the monitoring station (12 unique sites)
- `County`: County where the monitoring station is located

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Which columns contain numerical data, and which contain categories or text?**  
**Numerical data**: Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration, Daily AQI Value, Site Latitude, Site Longitude, Site ID  
**Categorical/text data**: Date, Units, Local Site Name, County

### üß© Analysis Planning
5Ô∏è‚É£ **What are 2-3 specific questions I want to answer with this data?**  
- How does air quality (PM2.5 levels) compare across the 12 monitoring sites in the Detroit metro area?
- Are there consistent temporal patterns in air quality across all sites (daily, weekly, or monthly trends)?
- Which monitoring sites consistently report the highest and lowest air quality, and how do these relate to their geographic locations?

6Ô∏è‚É£ **For each question, which columns will I need to analyze?**  
- For site comparison: Local Site Name, County, Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration, Daily AQI Value, Site Latitude, Site Longitude
- For temporal patterns: Date, Local Site Name, Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration
- For site ranking: Local Site Name, County, Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration, Daily AQI Value, Site Latitude, Site Longitude

7Ô∏è‚É£ **What kind of charts would best represent my findings?**  
- For site comparison: Bar chart showing average PM2.5 by monitoring site, with standard deviation indicators
- For temporal patterns: Multi-line chart showing PM2.5 levels over time for each site, with option to highlight specific sites
- For site ranking: Map visualization using latitude/longitude with color-coded markers based on average PM2.5 levels
- For overall trends: Calendar heatmap showing daily PM2.5 levels with color intensity representing AQI categories

### üéØ Visualization Planning
8Ô∏è‚É£ **For each chart I plan to create:**

**Bar Chart - Site Comparison**
- X-axis: 12 monitoring site names
- Y-axis: Average PM2.5 concentration
- Error bars: Standard deviation of readings to show variability
- Colors: Gradient based on EPA air quality categories
- Title: "Average PM2.5 Concentration by Monitoring Site (Q1 2025)"

**Multi-Line Chart - Temporal Patterns**
- X-axis: Date (Jan-Apr 2025)
- Y-axis: PM2.5 concentration
- Lines: 12 different colored lines (one per site) with toggle options
- Annotations: Weekend/weekday indicators
- Title: "Daily PM2.5 Concentrations Across Monitoring Sites"

**Map Visualization - Geographic Distribution**
- Base map: Detroit metropolitan area
- Markers: 12 monitoring sites plotted by lat/long coordinates
- Marker colors: Based on average PM2.5 levels (green to red scale)
- Tooltip: Site name, county, average PM2.5, number of days above threshold
- Title: "Geographic Distribution of Air Quality Monitoring Sites"

**Calendar Heatmap - Daily AQI Categories**
- Layout: Calendar view of Q1 2025
- Cell colors: EPA AQI category colors
- Aggregation: Average across all sites or selectable by site
- Title: "Daily Air Quality Index Categories (Q1 2025)"

### üí≠ Analysis Expectations
9Ô∏è‚É£ **What patterns or trends do I expect to find?**  
- Variation in PM2.5 levels between different counties and neighborhoods
- Consistent day-of-week patterns (e.g., higher levels on weekdays due to commuting)
- Correlations between site locations and PM2.5 levels (e.g., higher near industrial zones)
- Certain monitoring stations consistently showing higher or lower readings than others

üîü **What would be an interesting or surprising finding?**  
- Neighboring monitoring stations showing significantly different air quality measurements
- Unexpected spikes in PM2.5 levels that don't follow typical patterns
- Significant differences in air quality trends between different counties
- Certain days where all stations show abnormal readings, suggesting regional events

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ **How might this analysis be useful or interesting to others?**  
- Public health advocates can identify specific neighborhoods facing the highest pollution burden
- Community organizations can target educational outreach to the most affected areas
- Policy advocates can use site-specific data to push for localized interventions
- Researchers can examine how air quality varies across socioeconomic boundaries
- Residents can better understand the air quality patterns in their specific neighborhoods

## Step 3: Create Your Business Thesis

**Public Health Advocates** will use **Detroit Air Quality Analyzer** to compare PM2.5 pollution data across 12 monitoring sites in the Detroit metropolitan area to identify neighborhood-level disparities and support evidence-based advocacy for the most affected communities.

## Step 4: Identify the Most Significant Benefit

**Neighborhood-Level Insight**: The Detroit Air Quality Analyzer transforms complex air quality data from 12 monitoring sites into accessible, comparative visualizations that reveal neighborhood-level air quality disparities, enabling public health advocates to precisely identify the communities facing the highest pollution burden and target their limited resources where they can have the greatest impact.

## Step 5: Create the User Stories That Enable Users to Access Those Benefits

### Required User Stories:

1. **As a user, I can interact with a UI to choose which data analysis or visualization I want to see** so that I can access the air quality information I need for my advocacy work.

2. **As a user, I can read an "About Me" page** to learn about the web app's creator.

### Additional User Stories:

3. **As a public health advocate, I can view comparative PM2.5 levels across all 12 monitoring sites** so that I can identify which neighborhoods experience the poorest air quality.

4. **As a public health advocate, I can see daily PM2.5 trends for each monitoring site** so that I can understand temporal patterns and identify concerning periods.

5. **As a public health advocate, I can view a map showing the geographic distribution of air quality measurements** so that I can understand the spatial relationship between monitoring sites and their air quality readings.

6. **As a public health advocate, I can filter and compare specific monitoring sites** so that I can perform detailed analyses of neighborhoods of interest.

7. **As a public health advocate, I can download visualization images and data** so that I can include them in presentations and reports to community members and policymakers.
